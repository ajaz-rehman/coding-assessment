# Shopping Cart Application

This application has 3 main components and you should run them in this order:

1. Database: `postgres` directory (PostgreSQL + Docker).
2. Back-End: `shopping_cart_api` directory (Elixir + Phoenix).
3. Front-End: `shopping_cart_vue` directory (Vite + Vue + TypeScript).

You'll find detailed instructions inside each of these directories to run the application.

**NOTE**: If you're using VSCode, you can open this directory as a Workspace to easily navigate the context of each
directory.
